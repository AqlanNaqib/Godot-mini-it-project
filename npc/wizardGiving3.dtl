wizard3: "Whoa there, champ! Before you go charging in like a blind troll - important info! See these two death holes?"
- "They look... cozy?"
wizard3: "Cozy like a bear trap! Right one's got a Golem who thinks hugs mean 'crush spines.' Left one's got a Necromancer who's real bad at sharing - especially his fancy key."
- "Which one has the key?"
wizard3: "Here's the fun part - I dunno! Could be Mr. Rocks-for-Brains or Spooky McRaises-Dead. But! After you survive that mess, look for a weird wall and press [C] - like, really smash it. Secret door to Awesometown!"
- "So... the door wins the game?"
wizard3: "Wow, someone's paying attention! Yes! Beat a boss, get the key, find the magic door, press [C], and bam! You win! No applause, no parade - just sweet, sweet freedom." "Now pick your poison!"
